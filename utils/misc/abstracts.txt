- glosis_main: master module that imports all the components making the ontology simpler to use;
- iso28258: contains all ISO 28258 elements necessary to represent GloSIS, along with the mappings between ISO ontologies, SOSA/SSN, and GeoSPARQL;
- glosis_layer_horizon: contains all classes and properties to describe the domain of soil with a certain vertical extension, which is a layer (developed through non-pedogenic processes, displaying an unconformity to possibly over- or underlying adjacent domains) or a horizon (more or less parallel to the surface and is homogeneous for most morphological and analytical characteristics, developed in a parent material through pedogenic processes or made up of in-situ sedimented organic residues of up-growing plants (peat));
– glosis_siteplot: contains the classes and properties to describe soil sites (a defined area which is subject to a soil quality investigation) and soil plots (an elementary area where individual observations are made and/or samples are taken);
– glosis_profile: contains the classes and properties to describe a soil profile, which is a describable representation of the soil that is characterised by a vertical succession of horizons or at least one or several parent materials layers. Soil profile is an ordered set of soil horizons and/or layers; 
– glosis_surface: contains the classes and properties to describe soil surfaces (a subtype of a plot with surface shape. Surfaces may be located within other surfaces);
– glosis_observation: contains the spatial class to describe the observation process, which is a subtype of OM_Process, and it is used to generate the result of the observation;
– glosis_procedure: contains the code-lists identifying laboratory processes employed to assess physio-chemical soil properties;
– glosis_common: contains all classes and properties that are used among multiple modules;
– glosis_cl: contains all the code-lists;
– glosis_ext_property: module containing extension to the initially derived ontology;
– glosis_unit: module that introduces additional units of measurement that are absent from the qutd ontology.
