mineralConcKind,IC,,IC,Crack infillings,"Crack infillings refer to the materials that accumulate within cracks or fissures in the soil, typically formed due to drying or other physical stresses on the soil structure. These materials can include clays, silt, sand, or mineral deposits that enter cracks over time, often through the action of water or wind. Crack infillings can influence the soil's physical properties, such as its permeability and structure, as they may either facilitate or impede the movement of water and air through the soil. Additionally, crack infillings can impact soil fertility, as they may contain higher concentrations of certain nutrients or minerals that accumulate in these voids.

clay,CC,,CC,Clay Carbonate,"Clay carbonate refers to clay particles that are associated with or contain carbonate minerals, particularly calcium carbonate (CaCO₃). These carbonates are typically present in soils with higher pH (alkaline soils), and they play a significant role in buffering soil acidity. Clay-carbonate soils are found in regions with semi-arid and arid climates, where evaporation exceeds precipitation. These soils can have distinct properties, including a lower cation exchange capacity compared to non-carbonate soils and an ability to neutralize soil acidity, influencing both soil fertility and plant growth.

clay,CNC,,CNC,Clay Non-Carbonate,"Clay non-carbonate refers to the fraction of clay particles in soil that do not contain carbonates. Clay particles are very fine mineral components that contribute to the soil's texture and are typically smaller than 0.002 mm in diameter. The term non-carbonate implies that these clay particles are not associated with carbonate minerals, such as calcium carbonate (lime), which are commonly found in soils in arid or semi-arid regions. Non-carbonate clay soils are often more acidic, with higher cation exchange capacity, and may require different management practices, especially for nutrient availability and soil pH control.

clay,CWT,,CWT,Clay Water Dispersible,"Clay water dispersible refers to the portion of clay particles in soil that can be dispersed into water, forming a suspension when the soil is wetted. This characteristic is significant in assessing soil stability, particularly in the presence of water. Water-dispersible clays can lead to erosion problems, as the particles are more easily detached and transported by water. This term is important in understanding soil erodibility, especially in soils with high clay content that are prone to degradation when subjected to rainfall or irrigation. The dispersibility of clay affects both the physical structure and water-holding capacity of the soil.
