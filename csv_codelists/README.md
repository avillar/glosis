This folder contains the latest version of CSV files with codelists for the following modules: [glosis_cl](https://github.com/rapw3k/glosis/blob/master/glosis_cl.ttl) and [glosis_procedure](https://github.com/rapw3k/glosis/blob/master/glosis_procedure.ttl).

Those CSV files can be reused or updated using [the transformer_tool](https://github.com/rapw3k/glosis/tree/master/utils/transformer_tool). More details can be found in here: [transformer_tool_README](https://github.com/rapw3k/glosis/blob/master/utils/transformer_tool/README.md).

As it stands for today the files are being updated on demand, but in the future we plan to have a CI/CD cycle that will guarantee that the folder contains the latests data.
